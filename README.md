## Who am I?
I'm a Ghanaian software developer who watches too many car videos on YouTube, creates playlists for his friends and all who share my good taste in music *(if I do say so myself)* and has only one good selfie that I use everywhere *(take a guess which one)*.

## What do I do?
**I flutter!**<br>
I specialize in building cross-platform mobile, web & desktop apps with the awesome Flutter SDK.<br>
I'm also quickly assimilating Kotlin and Google Cloud Platform skills.
